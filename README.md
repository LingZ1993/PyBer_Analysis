# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis and Purpose
The purpose of this project is to compare the total fares, average fares per ride and also average fares per driver from three different city types which includes: Urban, Suburban and Rural areas. By doing this, we can present a perfect data and also graph for the CEO and for the CEO to decide how to allocate the best resources to different parts of the city. 

## Results
The results clearly shows that: Urban areas has most drivers, and also their total fares is the highest among three categories, but as for the average fares per driver we can see that the highest is the rural areas because the long distance and long hours. 

## Summary
By looking at the data and the graph, we can see that: 
1. Urban areas is the easiest part of the city to get a ride because there are more drivers. 
2. It maybe a factor to contribute to the fact that it would be harder to find a ride to get to the rural area because of the long distance, and also the passenger needs to consider that the fare would be much higher comparing with the urban area and suburban areas. 
3. By looking at the graph, we can clearly see that there are spikes and low points each week, so by taking a deeper look into the data, then we can determine what days in the week has the peak then we can deploy our drivers more efficiently.
